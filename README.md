# Gaming Trivia

![Device Mockups]()

## Project Objective
To create a browser based trivia game that challanges the users knowledge of video games, keeps record of the score, and is responsive on all media viewport widths. This game should be attractive to look at, easy to navigate, simple to control, and of course fun to play. The browser game will be built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript code. This project will also make use of the opentdb.com API and Bootstrap framework.

## Table of Contents

## UX

### Website Design Goals
- An attractive landing page that invites the user to take interest in the game
- A color palette that is easy on the eyes if the user is playing for extented periods
- The game area being easy to view the questions, submit answers, and to generally navigate
- An end of game section which tallies the score and provides words of congratulations or encouragement
- A website that works seamlessly on mobile, tablet and desktop devices
- Social media links for if the user wishes to share with friends

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to be invited to play by an attractive and fun landing page
- As a user, I want to click a button that starts the trivia game
- As a user, I want the game to have 20 questions
- As a user, I want the game to notify me if I have gotten the answer right or wrong
- As a user, I want the game to keep tabs on how many questions have been asked and answered
- As a user, I want a final tally of my score
- As a user, I want to see some kind of leaderboard functionality
- As a user, I want randomly selected questions to be pulled from a database to improve replayability
- As a user, I want the user interface to be bug free and easy to navigate

### Site Owner Goals

- To create an engaging experience for players that will keep them playing again and again
- To have a trivia game with a mix of easy to difficult questions

### User Requirements and Expectations

#### Requirements

- A landing page that explains what the website is and what is involved with the game
- All the buttons and links on the page function properly
- The website is easy to navigate
- That the game doesn't display the same question twice
- The game tallies my end score so I can see how I did

#### Expectations

- The questions are fun, challenging and diverse
- The game gives me a variety of choices per question
- The game gives me an indication whether I got the right or wrong answer
- I can add my final score to a leaderboard

### Design Choices

For overall design, I went will a classic arcade game look. The styling is minimalist and reminiscent of old video game backgrounds. I aim to make it appealing to classic and modern video game fans. I have opted for a dark background with all of the interactible elements being bright variants of red, green and blue.

#### Fonts

I went with Roboto Mono and monospace for my font as it has a classic video game program look to it. I also think it looks attractive as a white text on dark background. Since the website isn't very text heavy I feel the spaced out characters have a good appearance. It also adds extra emphasis to special characters and similar character types, adding extra edges, dashes or curves to maximise readability. I acquired this font on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono?query=roboto+mo#glyphs).

#### Icons

I used the free icons available on [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&p=2) to enhance and draw attention to certain sections of the page. The appropriate icons coincide with the topic being discussed in the text, such as using a gamepad and star icon for the 'Lets Play!' and 'Highscores' buttons on the landing page. Soical media icons are used instead of urls for asthetic enhancement. These icons are also styled alongside all other elements of the page so they blend seemlessly without sticking out.

Welcome JMuckian94,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use.

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidently make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**May 10 2021:** Added `heroku_config` script to allow Heroku API key to be stored as an environment variable.

**April 7 2021:** Upgraded the template for VS Code instead of Theia.

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

Happy coding!
